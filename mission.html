Most people don’t care to read the political platform for the senators that represent them. Some people don’t even read the platform of the president before casting their vote. </p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">Stance is designed to help you understand who is representing you, without doing tedious research. After you take a short political survey that covers flagship issues, we use an algorithm to compare your responses to the beliefs of U.S. senators. Based on that data, we can calculate how well each senator represents you on a ten-point scale.             </p>

          <span class="mt-2 block text-3xl text-center leading-8 font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Stance is a powerful tool, but:</span>
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8"> Keep in mind, we only have a snapshot of your political perspective. Our quiz covers the most important areas: gun control, abortion, economy, budget, healthcare, climate change, racial inequality, taxes, border security, economy, and death penalty, but our questions are also curt and sometimes binary. </p>

        <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">This means we don't gain a comprehensive understanding of your political stance. This is by choice. After all, we do not want to bombard you with a 100-question survey, even if it would allow us to get to know you more deeply. This choice was made to keep our service accessible, but it means you should take our recommendations with a grain of salt, even if it's a microscopic one. </p>

        <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">To understand how well each senator is representing you, we had to understand what each senator represents. This can be difficult. Sometimes we must try to rely on their voting data to infer their perspective on political issues, but some senators don't vote based on their beliefs. For example, senator Joe Manchin (D-W.VA) might believe that humans are responsible for the Earth warming, but he may vote against climate change reform because the economy of West Virginia relies heavily on its coal market. </p>

        <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">Nonetheless, we believe the resulting effect is the same. If two senators disagree on an idea, but vote the same way, it will impact you in the same way. In a perfect world, legislators would vote for what they believe. But some senators may lose their elections, and cede political power, and this is not a perfect world. This is politics. </p>

        <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">To the user: we love that you use stance. Whether you like (or know) it or not, legislation that passes through the Senate probably effects you. Our system makes it easy to find the representatives who can advocate for what you believe in. We created stance.org to foster political accountability and representation, but we also want to acknowledge its limitations.</p>
